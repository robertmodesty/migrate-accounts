Accounts Migration Utility

  Occasionally you need to migrate accounts from one server to another, most common solution is shell commands composed by yourself.  This project try to gave out a generalized utility to do that.  It starts from migration between distributions of Linux, and I hope it will become able to support other unix like operation systems.

  To migrate old accounts into the host just operating, mount the filesystem of old server on a mount point, then use this command:

    ./migratin MOUNT_POINT_OF_OLD_FILESYSTEM

SYNOPSIS

        ./migratin MOUNT_POINT_OF_OLD_FILESYSTEM [--start=1ST_USER_ID]
            [--end=LAST_USER_ID] [--passwd=OLD_passwd_FILE]
            [--shadow=OLD_shadow_FILE] [--group=OLD_group_FILE]
            [--gshadow=OLD_gshadow_FILE] [--loginshell=LOGIN_SHELL]
            [--no-eff-grp]

ARGUMENTS
